# Database Migrations

All database schema changes must go through Supabase CLI migrations — never modify the database manually.

## Workflow

1. Create a new migration:
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration new <short_description>
   ```
   This creates a timestamped SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`.

2. Write your SQL in the generated file. Follow these rules:
   - Add a header comment explaining the purpose
   - Always enable RLS: `alter table <table> enable row level security;`
   - Write granular RLS policies: one per operation (`select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`) and per role (`anon`, `authenticated`). Never use `FOR ALL`.
   - Use `if not exists` / `if exists` guards where appropriate
   - Add indexes on columns referenced in RLS policies that are not already primary keys

3. Test locally:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   ```
   This destroys and recreates the local DB, replaying all migrations from scratch.

4. Check migration status:
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration list
   ```

5. Deploy to remote (after `supabase link`):
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --dry-run   # preview first
   npx supabase db push             # apply
   ```

## Rules

- Never reset or revert a migration that has been deployed to production — always roll forward
- Never modify an existing migration file after it has been applied — create a new one instead
- Commit all migration files to version control
